## Setup

### Prerequisites

Docker has to be installed on your system. And a browser you'd recommend your friends.

### Building the Jupyter Lab container

`sh build.sh`

### Starting Jupyter Lab

`sh start.sh` will start the container which starts the jupyter server and provides you with an URL to open in your browser.

The URL looks like this (taken from the logs)

```
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
     ...
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=dd729b4069ce9ac463443e63faadca1bb4231bd4bea5579d
```
