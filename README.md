## Build & Run

### Prerequisites

Docker has to be installed on your system. And a browser you'd recommend your friends.

### Running Jupyter Lab

`sh run.sh`

This will build and run the docker container. Since this is very fast the building part is executed everytime for simplification.
The logs provide you with an URL to open in your browser:
```
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
     ...
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=dd729b4069ce9ac463443e63faadca1bb4231bd4bea5579d
```
